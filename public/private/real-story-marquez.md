# My Journey to Web Development

## Personal Introduction
I am John Nathaniel Marquez, a fresh graduate as of December 2024, residing in Amadeo, Cavite. This is my journey into web development, documenting my growth and experiences in the field of technology.

## Early Development Journey
During my second year of studies, I took my first steps into web development. I started with the fundamental technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

At this stage, my knowledge was basic as I was just beginning to understand how these technologies worked together. While I had limited understanding of how to use them properly, this period was crucial as it helped me build a foundation in web development fundamentals.

## Programming Language Evolution
As I progressed into my third year, my programming journey expanded. With some knowledge of Java already under my belt, I made a strategic decision to learn Python. I chose Python because:
- It offered a more straightforward approach compared to Java
- The basic syntax was easier to grasp
- It complemented my existing programming knowledge

While I had significant experience with Java and learned much from it, I ultimately decided not to pursue it further due to its time-intensive nature. This decision allowed me to focus on technologies that better aligned with my goals.

## Academic Foundation (First to Third Year)
Throughout my first three years of study, the curriculum focused heavily on teaching and reinforcing the fundamentals. This repetitive exposure to various programming languages and technologies helped solidify my understanding of core concepts and principles.

## Fourth Year: Practical Applications
My fourth year marked a significant transition from theoretical knowledge to practical applications through three major components:

### Capstone Project
Working with my group, we developed a practical IoT solution:
- Created an LPG gas detector system
- Utilized Arduino technology
- Implemented LED indicators
- Gained hands-on experience with hardware integration

### On-the-Job Training Experience
I completed my OJT at Excel Glass Inc., where I served as an IT Support specialist. My responsibilities included:
- Computer maintenance and troubleshooting
- Data entry using Microsoft Excel (basic only)
- General IT support and troubleshooting
- Self-directed learning and problem-solving

This OJT experience, though focused on IT support rather than development, provided valuable insights into real-world technical problem-solving and business operations.

### Final Project: First Steps into Modern Web Development
My final project marked a pivotal moment in my development journey, introducing me to API integration and modern web development concepts:

#### Discovery of APIs
- Initially encountered APIs through a professor's project requirement
- Had no prior knowledge of what APIs were or how they worked
- Began researching through web resources and ChatGPT to understand API concepts
- Learned about different types of APIs and their applications

#### Technology Stack Exploration
- Started with my familiar tools: Python, HTML, and CSS
- Discovered new frameworks through AI guidance:
  - Django
  - Flask
- Learned about these frameworks as potential solutions for API integration

#### First API Integration
- Successfully developed a Weather API integration
- This project became my first experience with API implementation
- Utilized AI tools for learning and development guidance
- Marked the beginning of my journey using AI as a development tool

This experience was particularly significant as it opened my eyes to modern web development practices and the power of AI tools in learning and development.

## Post-Graduation Journey

### Expanding Technical Knowledge
After completing my final project, I embarked on a journey to broaden my technical expertise:
- Learned version control systems:
  - Git fundamentals
  - GitHub repository management
- Explored development tools and best practices:
  - Environment variables (dotenv)
  - Various frameworks
  - VSCode extensions

### AI-Assisted Development Evolution
My journey with AI tools in development has progressively evolved:
- Started with basic VSCode AI extensions
- Expanded to using ChatGPT for development assistance
- Integrated Blackbox AI into my workflow
- Discovered and adopted Cursor AI as my primary development tool
  - Chose Cursor AI for its robust feature set
  - Leveraged its comprehensive development capabilities
- Explored WindSurf AI for additional capabilities

### First Professional Project
After graduation, I took on my first significant professional project:
- Secured a web development project with my former OJT company (Excel Glass Inc.)
- Received comprehensive project requirements and information
- Applied my expanded knowledge of web development
- Utilized AI tools to enhance development efficiency

### Current Focus
My current development approach centers on:
- Maintaining basic knowledge of API integration while focusing on other core competencies
- Continuously learning through:
  - YouTube tutorials
  - Web resources
  - AI-assisted development tools
- Prioritizing proper tool usage and best practices
- Careful management of project credentials and sensitive information

This phase of my journey represents a significant transition from academic to professional development, marked by practical application of skills and continuous learning through modern development tools.

## Portfolio Development and Learning Challenges

### Frontend Portfolio Projects
To build my portfolio, I developed several frontend projects:
- Edible Artistry website
- Kusina de Amadeo website
These projects helped me strengthen my frontend development skills while building a diverse portfolio.

### Full-Stack Development Journey
My journey into full-stack development was marked by significant projects and learning experiences:

#### Wedding Memories Blog with Real-Time Guestbook
- Developed a full-stack web application for my cousin's wedding
- Created a digital guestbook with real-time messaging functionality
- Integrated frontend and backend components successfully
- Key features:
  - Wedding photo gallery and memories
  - Real-time guestbook messaging system
  - Interactive guest engagement
- Utilized Cursor AI for development assistance
- Project enhanced my full-stack development skills and boosted my confidence
- Marked a significant milestone in my backend development journey

#### Food Ordering System Challenge
This became my most ambitious and ongoing project:
- Started development in September 2023
- Underwent multiple iterations in local development
- Each iteration brought new learning opportunities:
  - Backend development fundamentals
  - Database management
  - System architecture
  - Error handling and debugging
- Current Status:
  - Armed with better knowledge and clear direction
  - Continuing development with improved understanding
  - Planning to complete the system with newly acquired skills
  - Using past project experiences as foundation
  - Leveraging AI tools more effectively

This ongoing project represents both my biggest challenge and my most significant learning opportunity. While it remains a work in progress, each iteration has contributed to my growth as a developer.

### Learning Through Persistence
Despite being new to backend technologies, I:
- Conducted extensive research on backend development
- Utilized AI tools to understand complex concepts
- Maintained persistence through multiple iterations
- Gradually built understanding of backend systems
- Embraced the learning process despite being a beginner
- Progressed from basic websites to full-stack applications in months
- Learned to leverage AI effectively while understanding the fundamentals

This period demonstrates my commitment to growth through challenging projects, even when facing unfamiliar technologies and complex requirements. My journey from September to now shows rapid progress in web development capabilities, even without extensive prior programming knowledge.
