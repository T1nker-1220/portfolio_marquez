## *TECHNICAL SKILLS QUESTIONS*
------------------------------------------------------------
### **What programming languages and technologies are you most comfortable with?**
For frontend development, I work with Next.js 14+ with TypeScript, TailwindCSS for styling, modern React patterns and hooks, responsive design principles, and UI libraries like shadcn/ui. In backend and database work, I use Next.js API routes, Python for backend logic, database management with Supabase, and API integration. I also use development tools like Git for version control, VS Code with Cursor AI, ESLint for code quality, Vercel for deployment, and AI tools to help with debugging and optimization.
------------------------------------------------------------
### **How do you approach learning new technologies or frameworks?**
I follow a step-by-step approach to learning. First, I start by understanding the basic concepts through documentation. Then I use resources like YouTube tutorials and AI tools to learn more. I practice by building real projects - I've built a modern website for Excel Glass Inc., a weather application with API integration, a wedding memories website, and a restaurant management system called Kusina de Amadeo. As I learn, I gradually work on more complex features. I also use Cursor AI to help me understand best practices.
------------------------------------------------------------
### **How do you handle debugging and troubleshooting?**
When I debug, I use several methods together. I use AI tools like Cursor AI to help find and fix problems. I break big problems into smaller parts that are easier to solve. I look at documentation and online resources for help. I test things step by step to find what's causing the problem. I also write down solutions so I can use them again in the future.

## *PROJECT EXPERIENCE QUESTIONS*
------------------------------------------------------------
### **Can you tell me about a challenging project you've worked on?**
One of my most challenging projects was a Food Ordering System that I started in November 2024 and continue working on in 2025. This project was challenging because it needed both frontend and backend skills. Through multiple versions of the project, I learned a lot about system architecture, database management, error handling, and full-stack development. Even though it was difficult, I kept working on it and learned something new with each version.
------------------------------------------------------------
### **How do you ensure the quality of your code?**
To make sure my code is good quality, I follow best practices and coding standards. I use Git to keep track of changes and test everything carefully before deploying. I also use AI tools to review and improve my code. I keep my code organized and write good documentation to help others understand it.
------------------------------------------------------------
### **Have you worked with clients before? How do you handle client communication?**
During my OJT at Excel Glass Inc., I worked as an IT Support specialist and later did web development for them. This taught me important things about working with clients. I learned how important it is to communicate clearly, understand what clients need, be responsive and professional, and explain technical things in simple ways that clients can understand.
------------------------------------------------------------
## *PROBLEM-SOLVING QUESTIONS*
------------------------------------------------------------
### **How do you stay updated with the latest web development trends?**
I keep up with web development by watching online tutorials and reading documentation. I watch YouTube videos about web development and use AI tools to learn new things. I practice using new technologies and build projects using modern tools and frameworks to stay current.
------------------------------------------------------------
### **How do you handle tight deadlines or multiple projects?**
When dealing with deadlines, I make clear lists of what needs to be done and put them in order of importance. I break big projects into smaller parts that are easier to manage. I use techniques to manage my time well. I always let people know how the work is going, and I ask for help or more information when I need it.
------------------------------------------------------------
### **What do you do when you encounter a problem you can't solve immediately?**
When I face a difficult problem, I first try to solve it with what I already know. If that doesn't work, I look at documentation and online resources. I use AI tools like Cursor AI to help guide me. I try to break the problem into smaller parts that are easier to solve. If I still need help, I ask others for their ideas or suggestions.
